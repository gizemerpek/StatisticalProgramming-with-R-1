# StatisticalProgramming-with-R-1

IdNo: Id numbers of individuals in the sample
Group: categorical (nominal) variable with 4 levels (Group1, Group2, Group3 and Group4)
Gender: categorical (nominal) variable with 2 levels (Male and Female)
Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Var6, Var7 and Var8: continuous (ratio) variables. 

1) Please make barplots for categorical variables (Group and Gender) by writing your own 
function using r-project:
a. The function should have options of main title, x and y labels, x and y limits, color 
options. 
b. Categorical variables (such as Group and Gender) could be barplotted .
c. Two different categorical (such as Group and Gender) variables could be 
barplotted horizontally or vertically in the same page  together.

2) Please make histogram for continuous variables (Var1-Var8) by writing your own function 
using r-project:
a. The function should have options of the number of bins, main title, x and y labels, 
x and y limits, color options. 
b. Each histogram should be plotted in the output screen.
c. More than one histogram could be plotted in the output screen together. 

3) Please make boxplot for continuous variables (Var1-Var8) by writing your own function 
using r-project:
a. The function should have options of main title, x and y labels, x and y limits, color 
options. 
b. Each boxplot should be plotted in the output screen. 
c. More than one boxplot could be plotted in the output screen together (for 
example V1, V3 and V5). 
d. Boxplot for a continuous variable could be plotted based on a categorical variable
in the output screen (for example boxplot of V1 based on Gender).
